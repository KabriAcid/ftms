You can install multiple Composer packages at once using the following command:  

```sh
composer require dompdf/dompdf intervention/image spatie/laravel-backup ramsey/uuid nesbot/carbon
```

This will install:  
- **dompdf/dompdf** (for PDF generation)  
- **intervention/image** (for image processing)  
- **spatie/laravel-backup** (for backups)  
- **ramsey/uuid** (for unique identifiers)  
- **nesbot/carbon** (for advanced date handling)  

Let me know if you need more packages! ðŸš€
